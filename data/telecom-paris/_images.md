# Image, Modeling, Analysis, GEometry, Synthesis [IMAGES]

The IMAGES team (Image, Modeling, Analysis, GEometry, Synthesis) carries out
research in image analysis and understanding, computer vision and 3D computer
graphics, covering the entire spectrum of the modeling, analysis,
transformation, representation, interpretation and synthesis of images, 3D and
digital objects. The team focuses on the modeling of images, tri-dimensional
and numerical objects, with the development of mathematical models, ranging
from the physical acquisition to the high-level interpretation, and artificial
intelligence models (spatial reasoning, knowledge representation). The team
has also a strong expertise in computer graphics for geometric modeling, image
synthesis, virtual reality and 3D interactive systems. The team deals with
applications in medical imaging, remote sensing imaging, computational
photography and creative industries.

Our key contributions are in the following fields:

  * Mathematical methods and artificial intelligence
  * Virtual reality and computer graphics
  * Image processing applications to the society
